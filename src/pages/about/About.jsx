      Hi! I’m Emma, a 22-year-old Full-Stack Developer with a deep passion for technology and a strong foundation in web development. Recently, I completed an intensive Full-Stack Web Development bootcamp at Ironhack, where I gained practical, hands-on experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. Through this bootcamp, I learned to think like a developer—problem-solving, adapting quickly, and tackling new challenges head-on.

I might be at the beginning of my professional journey, but I’m committed to continuous learning and constantly building on my skills. I’m a fast learner and thrive on discovering new technologies and frameworks to enhance my knowledge and deliver more efficient solutions. Technology excites me, and I find it incredibly rewarding to dive into complex problems, using the best tools and approaches to make development both smooth and scalable.

One of my biggest strengths is my enthusiasm for collaboration and growth. I’m a strong believer in teamwork, as I know that working with others not only strengthens the end product but also accelerates my own learning. I’m eager to find opportunities in dynamic, creative environments where I can contribute meaningfully, continue to grow as a developer, and make a positive impact.

Whether remote or in person, I’m open to relocating if the right opportunity comes along. I look forward to bringing my skills, dedication, and energy to a team that values innovation and growth just as much as I do!
